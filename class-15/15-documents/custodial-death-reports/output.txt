Summary:

On 5/07/2006, at approximately 02:01 hours, Officer Bagley was on routine patrol in the parking lot of 4060
Beltline Rd, Papas Pizza.

Officer Bagley observed a white male subject, later identified as Anthony Brown. Brown was approximately
6'1" and 200 pounds and was wearing denim shorts and a sports jersey. Brown was speaking with two
females and one male in the east side of the parking lot. Witnesses in the parking lot flagged Officer Bagley
down and told him Brown had been inside the business acting weird and that guy is on something.

Officer Bagley approached Brown and attempted to speak with him. Brown pushed Ofc. Bagley and ran yelling
and screaming northbound toward Beltline Rd. Officer Bagley stated he caught Brown and Brown began to
fight. Brown struck Officer Bagley several times and was able to get away. Officer Bagley caught Brown in the
outside lane of Beltline Rd. And grabbed Brown around his chest and shoulder. Brown continued to fight
Officer Bagley and began flailing around and screaming in an attempt to get away.

Brown continued to struggle. Officer Bagley released his hold and radioed for assistance. Officer Bagley was
able to regain control over Brown and was assisted by two citizens who had stopped to help. Brown continued
to fight Officer Bagley and the two citizens.

Officer Barnett arrived at 02:03:54 hours to assist and Officer Krause arrived at 02:05:39. Officer Bagley
notified dispatch at 02:06:41 that Brown was now in custody. Officer Hardin arrived at 02:06:59 to assist. Once
on scene, Officer Hardin requested another unit and Addison Paramedics because Brown continued to
struggle. Sgt. Gilbert arrived at 02:09:27 to assist and Officer Allen arrived at 02:12 to assist.

Addison Medic 102 and Engine 102 were notified at 02:07:23 and arrived at 02:11:10 hours. Brown was
evaluated by emergency personnel who determine Brown was in medical distress. Brown was transported to
RHD Hospital where doctors pronounced him deceased.
