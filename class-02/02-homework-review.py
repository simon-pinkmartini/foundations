## TIPS
How fast does a rabbit's heart beat? I don't know, I'm not a vet - Google it!
If you're having trouble wrapping your head around a problem, write out what you want to do in steps before you try to write the actual Python code.
XXX billion will involve division.
You might end up googling multiple comparisons in an 'if' statement, adding one to variables, the else and elif operators (that's advanced conditionals!), and modulo (for the even/odd one).
